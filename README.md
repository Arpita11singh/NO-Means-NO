# NO-Means-NO
My Project aims to protect women, children, men, and the elderly.
Sexual assault is a deeply distressing and prevalent issue affecting individuals worldwide. It involves any unwanted sexual contact or behavior without explicit consent, encompassing a range of actions from harassment to violent acts. Survivors often face significant physical, emotional, and psychological consequences. Addressing sexual assault requires a collective commitment to raising awareness, providing support, and fostering a culture of consent and respect. It is essential to prioritize survivor well-being, challenge societal norms that perpetuate assault, and work towards creating environments where everyone feels safe and empowered.
